# Week 2

Welcome to Week 2!

Please note that there will be no lecture this week due to the Easter holidays. However, we will still be meeting for tutorial sessions, during which we will form groups of 3-4 students and begin working on the group assignment. For further instructions, please consult the course manual.

As a group, you will have the option to select one of the following datasets:

1. [Podcast dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/roman6335/13000-itunes-podcasts-april-2018)
2. [News dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/szymonjanowski/internet-articles-data-with-users-engagement?select=articles_data.csv)
3. [Books dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/bilalyussef/google-books-dataset?select=google_books_1299.csv) (specifically, select the `google_books_1299.csv`).

Alternatively, you may search for a dataset on your own. If you choose to do so, please ensure that the dataset contains a column with text data and preferably includes ratings or votes to indicate the popularity of the items. Please consult with your tutorial lecturer in that case.
